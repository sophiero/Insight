## Dataset Sources

The data came from two sources.
Satellite images were fetched from Sentinel-2, and crop labels were

1. Sentinel-2
Sentinel-2 is an earth observation mission from the EU Copernicus Programme.
It offers global satellite imagery, which is recaptured every 5 days.
The data images are captured at high spatial resolution (10m), with 13 spectral bands.

2. CropScape
CropScape offers crop-specific land cover data layer in the US based on USDA agricultural reports.
Crop labels can be queried by area of interest, year and crop.
